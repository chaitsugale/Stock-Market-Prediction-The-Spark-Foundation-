# Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis

This project is a part of The Sparks Foundation GRIP internship which highlights time series analysis of historical stock prices and sentimental analysis of news headlines.

The historical stock prices dataset has been extracted from YAHOO FINANCE (https://finance.yahoo.com/) which can be use firectly from yfinance Python API (https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) where we have extracted Bombay Stock Exchange data from 1st January 2001 to 31st March 2022.

The news headlines data is used from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/therohk/india-headlines-news-dataset).I have used kaggle API to extrach dataset directly from Kaggle API (Reference : ) which has data from 1st January 2001 to 31st March 2022.

I have used Auto-ARIMA model to make stock market prices predictions using the historical stock prices data. 

In the sentiment analysis model, I have made use of different machine learning algorithms-Random Forest Regressor, LightGBM, Adaboost and Xgboost- to make the predictions.
